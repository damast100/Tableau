Map Analysis
-While putting together the starting and ending maps, we could see that most of the starting stations in the second quarter of 2022 were in and around Jersey City and Hoboken and not downtown New York City. This appears to be due to a lot of people that live outside the city but work in Manhatten. By using the Citi Bike program, they are able to easily get from their homes outside the city to their work in Manhatten using these bicycles so they do not need to use their cars or worry about parking their cars in Manhatten.

Popular Station Analysis
-When comparing the top 20 stations for both starting and ending locations to the maps that were created, we could a similar trend that most of the popular stations for starting and ending were in and around Jersey City and Hoboken. We believe that the main trend with this is that a lot of people live outside of Manhatten but still work in the city. Therefore, they are needing to get to and from work efficiently and cost effectively so they are looking to continue using the bike program to get around the area instead of using cars to get around which can take an extended amount of time to get places. This is supported by our line graph that is showing that the most popular times for people to use the bikes is starting around 8 A.M. and around 5 to 6 P.M. which indicates that people are getting the bikes to go to work and to leave from work.

Classic/Electric Bike Analysis
-We put together two different pie charts to show the difference between the classic bike counts and the electric bike counts for the second quarter of 2022. Then we broke down the data further to show whether the person was a member of the program or a casual rider. We can see that over twice as many members using the classic bikes when compared to the casual rider. However, when comparing the electric bike pie chart, we could see the number was closer together. The number of casual riders of electric bikes was a little over 10,000 less than the members of the bike program but that is significantly closer than the classic bikes. We can see that the members of the bike program are more likely to use the classic bikes than the electric bikes. This is an interesting trend as the electric bikes are likely to get the person around faster but it seems like more members of the bike program are not as likely to use them. This could be due to cost or other contributing factors that we are not able to deduct from this analysis.
